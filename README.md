# Stand-ups Visualisation Backend

A simple Express, PostgresSQL and Sequelize Web API and Database for the storage and serving of data from SOON_'s daily morning stand-ups.

This project was used as a learning tool for the Express application generator, Sequelize, Sequelize CLI, relational databases, HAL API structure and api blueprint.

This API is used with other web services where SOON_ standup data is required. For example CLIs where standup data can be entered and posted  to this server to be saved.

This API utilises SOON_'s `node-standups` node module in the database seeding process.
